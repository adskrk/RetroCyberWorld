GDG Retro Cyber World üåê
Project Overview
Welcome to the GDG Retro Cyber World, a project for the Google Developer Group's technical assessment. This web application is a digital terminal with a retro-cyber aesthetic inspired by 1990s hacker culture. It challenges users to discover a hidden secret key through a two-step authentication process. The project showcases skills in full-stack development, themed design, and creative problem-solving.



Technical Architecture
This project is built using a simple yet robust full-stack architecture:

Backend: The backend is powered by Python and the Flask micro-framework. It handles the core logic, including user authentication and serving the secret key. We implemented 

JWT (JSON Web Token) to secure a protected endpoint, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the hidden information.

Frontend: The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML provides the basic structure of the terminal interface.


CSS applies the retro-cyber aesthetics, including neon color schemes, monospace fonts, and a scanline effect.


JavaScript handles all interactive elements, such as the simulated command line and communication with the backend APIs.

Secret Key Discovery Process
<details>
<summary><b>SPOILER ALERT: Click to reveal the solution</b></summary>
<br>
The secret key is hidden behind a two-step authentication process that requires investigative effort.

Login: To gain a valid authentication token, you must type the login command into the terminal interface. This command uses hardcoded credentials (hacker / cyberpunk2025) to authenticate with the backend and receive a JWT.

Access the Secret: Once authenticated, the token is stored in your browser's local storage. You can then type the secret command. The JavaScript will send your token to the protected /secret endpoint, and the backend will validate the token before revealing the secret key.
